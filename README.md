# Calender App

#### Implement a calender app

Implement a **calender app** that shows all the public holidays of that year, the application should meet the below requirements:

- Use any **calender API** for real-time data (example: **https://www.abstractapi.com/holidays-api**), you can use a mock response as well for the API call (the main idea to implement the overall logic).
- The user should have a feasibility to enter the **country**, **year** and **month** as well. by default, it should take current year and display all the public holidays.
- The calender should be displayed on a table with the **date** and the **reason** for the public holiday.
